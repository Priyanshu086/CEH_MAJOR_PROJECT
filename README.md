# CEH_MAJOR_PROJECT
This project simulates real-world cyber-attacks on a cloud-based enterprise environment. Students perform Red Team attacks to generate security logs and analyze them using a SIEM platform. Based on findings, system and network hardening is applied, and attacks are repeated to validate improved security and detection.
